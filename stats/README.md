# Stats

This folder contains multiple scripts that collect a variety of statistical data about the dataset.

- [`corrupted_3d_structures.py`](./corrupted_3d_structures.py) provides statistics on corrupted PDB files as presented in the thesis.
- [`protrusion_distribution.py`](./protrusion_distribution.py) shows the distribution of protrusion values for *binding* and *non-binding* residues.
- [`protrusion_distribution_per_ligand.py`](./protrusion_distribution_per_ligand.py) displays the distribution of protrusion values for *binding* and *non-binding* residues, differentiated by various ligands.
- [`SASA_vector_distribution.py`](./SASA_vector_distribution.py) presents the distribution of SASA values for *binding* and *non-binding* residues.
- [`yu_ds_summary.py`](./yu_ds_summary.py) generates a LaTeX table as presented in the thesis.
